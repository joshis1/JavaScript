# What is pub/sub?

It is a pattern where the publisher is not programmed to send a message (payload) to a specific 
reciever. These messages are sent by publishers to specific channels, and receivers can subscribe to one or more channels to consume those same messages.

## Going to use Redis as a pub/sub.
